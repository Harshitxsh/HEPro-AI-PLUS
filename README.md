# HEPro AI+ 🚀

### A Smart Student Mentoring & Decision Intelligence System

---

## 🧩 What is HEPro AI+?

HEPro AI+ is an AI-powered system designed to **understand students beyond marks**.

Instead of waiting for students to fail, this system proactively identifies:

* hidden stress
* declining engagement
* productivity issues
* career confusion

…and automatically recommends **what action should be taken and who should take it**.

It transforms raw student data into **clear, actionable mentoring decisions**.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Most systems only show *what is wrong*.
HEPro AI+ goes one step further — it answers:

> **“What should we do next?”**

This shift from analysis → action is what makes it a **Decision Intelligence System**, not just an ML project.

---

## 🔄 How the System Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Data Generation

The system starts with a realistic dataset of students containing:

* academic performance
* attendance
* stress & wellness indicators
* productivity & focus metrics

---

### 2️⃣ Rule-Based Scoring (SRI)

Each student is evaluated using a composite score:

**SRI (Student Readiness Index)** based on:

* Academic Performance (APS)
* Wellness (WWS)
* Productivity (PTMS)
* Career Readiness (CRS)

This ensures **interpretability and transparency**.

---

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning (Clustering)

Using **K-Means (K=4)**, students are grouped into behavioral personas such as:

* High-Achieving but Stressed
* Career Confused
* Stable & Balanced
* High-Risk Disengaged

This helps uncover patterns that simple scores cannot.

---

### 4️⃣ Decision Intelligence Engine

This is the core of the system.

It decides:

* What is the student's biggest problem?
* What type of help is needed?
* Which mentor should be assigned?

Key logic:

* Wellness is always prioritized first
* High-risk students get immediate attention
* Mentor assignment is based on expertise + availability

---

### 5️⃣ Mentor Matching System

The system intelligently assigns:

* Career mentors
* Wellness counselors
* Productivity coaches

It also ensures:

* No mentor overload
* Balanced workload distribution

---

### 6️⃣ Outputs Generated

The system produces:

* 📄 `final_recommendations.csv`
  → Complete mentoring plan for each student

* ⚠ `alert_log.txt`
  → High-risk student alerts requiring immediate action
